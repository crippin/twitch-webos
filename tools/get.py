You agree that LGE may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK, or any features within the SDK to You or to users generally, at LGE’s sole discretion, without prior notice to You.<br/><br/>2.8	Nothing in this License Agreement gives You any right to use any of LGE’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names or other distinctive brand features.<br/><br/>2.9	You agree that You shall not remove, obscure or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.<br/><br/>2.10 To the extent that an Application developed by You using the SDK collects and processes the personal and non-personal information of Users, You shall:<br/>(a) Comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to data protection and privacy;<br/>(b) Put in place a privacy policy that informs Users of the types of information that may be collected and the purposes for which this information is collected and processed;<br/>(c) Provide a mechanism for obtaining User consent to the collection and processing of their information in accordance with the User’s privacy policy before the collection of any such information; <br/>(d)	Not collect any information from Users (whether personal or otherwise) unless the appropriate consents have been given;<br/>(e) Only collect, access and use User’s information to the extent necessary for providing the application; <br/>(f) Put in place appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to secure and protect User information; and<br/>(g) Indemnify LGE against any claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to any breach by You of this section 2.10.<br/>2.11	Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind(including, but not limited to, text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that LGE reasonably determines to be objectionable or inappropriate, for example, materials that may be considered obscene, pornographic of defamatory.<br/>2.12	You acknowledge and agree that the SDK is not designed, intended, or certified for use in components of systems or Application intended for the operation of weapons, weapons systems, nuclear installations, means of mass transportation, aviation, medical or life-support computers or equipment (including resuscitation equipment and surgical implants), pollution control, hazardous substances management, or for any other dangerous Application in which the failure of the SDK could create a situation where personal injury or death may occur.

The failure or delay of LGE to exercise any right under this License Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and shall not prevent LGE from demanding full and exact compliance with this License Agreement.
